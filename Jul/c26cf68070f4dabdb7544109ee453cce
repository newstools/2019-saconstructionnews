Preparations are well underway for another spectacular occasion celebrating innovation, quality, outstanding workmanship and professionalism in the engineering industry as Consulting Engineers South Africa (CESA) and the engineering community get ready for the prestigious CESA Aon Engineering Excellence Awards.  “Given the pivotal role that infrastructure development plays in the South African economy in achieving the goals of the National Development Plan and Vision 2030, as stated in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address (SONA) these awards highlight the role that Consulting Engineers and their Clients play in providing Excellence in Engineering for economic development and job creation,” states CESA CEO, Chris Campbell. Taking place on the 14th August and celebrating its 47th year, this event with platinum sponsorship from Aon South Africa for over 20 years, is one of the highlights in the engineering and construction industry calendar and provides CESA, its Member Firms and Clients the opportunity to boast about the extent of innovation and expertise in the industry where engineering excellence is rewarded. “An enormous responsibility lies upon your shoulders as the consulting engineers in South Africa, but by the same token, to deliver on these responsibilities, consulting engineers have to operate in a secure, risk-managed environment.   It’s our role at Aon South Africa to facilitate that environment, and to ensure that you have a professional and qualified team on your side, every step of the way,” says Terence Williams, CEO of Aon South Africa.  In support of Youth and Job Creation, Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) have been a proud sponsor of the Young Engineer of the Year category for close to 10 years.
