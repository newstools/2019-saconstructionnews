On 5th July 2019, three site managers were crowned national winners at NHBC’s 10th annual Health and Safety Awards in Birmingham hosted by Comedian Hugh Dennis.  This is the only health and safety recognition scheme in the UK exclusively for home builders. National award winners Billy McCallum (Large builder category) from CALA Homes, Dave Brown (Medium builder category) from Wainhomes and Adam Hedley (Multi-storey category) from Berkeley Homes were praised by the judges for an impressive range of initiatives focussed on maintaining the health, safety and wellbeing of the people working on site as well as and the public. Organised by NHBC, the UK’s leading new home warranty and insurance provider, and independently judged by the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB), The Construction Products Association and the, the awards are the ultimate competition for house builders with exceptional health and safety standards. The judges were looking for site managers who continuously go above and beyond industry standard such as effective planning before a project starts, a tidy, well-organised site as well as an outstanding infrastructure that supports the site manager. Steve Wood, NHBC Chief Executive, said: “It's been a fantastic year with a record number of entries; we had an outstanding shortlist of finalists this year, strengthening the importance given to health and safety on house-building sites across the UK. “NHBC believes it is crucial to recognise and reward those house builders that demonstrate commitment to continuous improvement in preventing accidents and ill health not just onsite but the surrounding community it works in. “This year’s winners demonstrated their commitment to maintaining an excellent health and safety record while keeping up with the growing demand for quality new homes. We offer them our congratulations."
