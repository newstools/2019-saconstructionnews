Dry-type transformer specialist Trafo Power Solutions has supplied four purpose-designed units to the University of Witwatersrand (Wits) as part of the institution’s electrical infrastructure upgrades on both its Braamfontein and Parktown campuses.  According to Trafo Power Solutions managing director David Claassen, Wits decided to replace the original oil-cooled transformers with the dry-type, cast-resin transformers. These are safer and more environmentally-friendly due to the absence of oil in the system. “The high safety factor associated with dry-type transformers has an impact on flexibility and cost,” says Claassen. “The user can be more flexible in terms of where the units are installed, as they can be placed indoors, in basements or in other confined spaces for convenience. This also means the cost of building special infrastructure for outside installations – a requirement of oil-cooled transformers – can be avoided.”  He highlights that Trafo Power Solutions was closely involved from the proposal stage in this project, providing the necessary application engineering to ensure the appropriate design for the generator company responsible. “As specialists in transformer technology, our expertise is not just in the product that we are installing but also in understanding the bigger picture – the infrastructure requirements as a whole,” he says. “Any successful installation is a close collaboration between Trafo Power Solutions, the engineering company, the consultants and the contractors to ensure that the final result is fit for purpose and serves the customer’s need.” With the growing installed base of dry-type transformers in the global marketplace, the price differential between this design and that of conventional transformers has become insignificant. This has opened the door for users to take advantage of the numerous benefits of dry-type transformers, he says.
