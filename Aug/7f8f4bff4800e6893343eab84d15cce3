 We are at the dawn of a new digital revolution which is fundamentally changing the way we design, build, and even the type of people who will design the built environment of the future.  Peter Ayres, the newly-appointed Global Structures Leader for engineering, design and advisory company, Aurecon, believes that this change, enabled by technology, is releasing engineers from time-consuming mathematics to more creative idea formation.  He shares that as technology enables the design of complex structures to be completed faster and with less effort from humans, this will enable engineers to spend more time on empathy and ideas rather than logic and numbers.
