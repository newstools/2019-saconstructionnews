“Never conclude a person by his present status because time has the great power and ability to change a useless coal into a valuable diamond” ~ Punita Sah  Still the pioneer project of its kind Tshwane Regional Mall, TRM as affectionately known, is a jewel in the making. With construction almost at completion, this development has a healthy future. The mall is at the epicenter of convenience for residences. It brings transport, shopping and community together in one place. Because of its strategic location, the gateway to Mamelodi, the site has access to approximately two hundred and twenty thousand daily commuters and a large number of private cars during peak times.  The development has a rich commuter market and being at the historic & preferred intermodal transport hub adds to the value of this diamond in the rough. Busy with mall finishes, the likes of Spar, Pick n Pay, Choppies – some of the anchor tenants – are busy with shop fittings. Some of the stores anticipated to be part of the TRM family includes, in the food court – KFC; Roman’s; Maxbox; Braai block, for the health offering there is the likes of Clicks and Mamelodi Health Group.  This is just the tip of what the mall will be offering Mamelodi.  Looking to warrant the glimmer of the diamond shines bright, the mall developers have ensured the community benefits through affording the backbone of Denneboom upgraded facilities to operate from. Housing the informal traders and taxi associations is imperative and the mall will have square meters to accommodate 600 informal traders and the three large taxi ranks that have been in existence for years. “If you chase perfection, you often catch excellence.” ~ William Fowble. This is the hope of Tshwane Regional Mall.
