Climate change is a trending topic that is gaining momentum. With movements like 16-year old Greta Thunbergâ€™s Fridays for the Future gaining notoriety this is something that we need to address.  It is no secret that the building and construction industry has a huge impact on the environment. According to research done by Saint-Gobain, the built environment globally is responsible for 33% of energy consumption, 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, 40% of solid waste streams (in developed countries) and 40% of raw material consumption. In Africa, 56% of all energy use is attributed to the built environment which is responsible for between 25-40% of all waste generation, 5% of all water consumption and 3,9 tons of CO2E (greenhouse gas emissions). Atisha Gopichund-Lutchman, Director of TechnoMarketing at Saint-Gobain elaborates on how sustainable construction methods are becoming even more important within the climate change space.
