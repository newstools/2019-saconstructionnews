NHBC, the UK’s leading new home warranty and insurance provider has announced the winners in the first round of its flagship competition dedicated to recognising site managers who achieve the highest standards in house building.  Nearly 450 UK site managers have won a Quality Award in the first round of NHBC Pride in the Job Awards 2019, representing the top 3% of the sixteen thousand site managers entered. Being selected as one of the UK’s top site managers is testament to their commitment to delivering quality homes for residents. Now in its 39th year, the Awards are the most highly regarded competition in the house-building industry. Judging for the Awards is rigorous, beginning in July 2018, with each site manager assessed across these six key areas: consistency, attention to detail, leadership, interpretation of drawings and specifications, technical expertise and health and safety. The Quality Award winners will now go on to compete for Seal of Excellence and Regional Awards that will be announced at events across the UK in the autumn, with the Supreme Award winners unveiled at a gala ceremony in January 2020. Commenting on the Awards, NHBC Chief Executive Steve Wood said: “Launched nearly 40 years ago, Pride in the Job has been instrumental in driving up the quality of new homes. Despite the challenges the industry has faced in recent times, this year’s winners have kept their focus on delivering high quality new homes for their customers. “A site manager’s role is undoubtedly one of the toughest in house building and their drive for excellence is very much at the heart of the competition. Receiving a Quality Award is a great achievement for any site manager. It’s no surprise that Pride in the Job winning sites have higher levels of customer satisfaction as these homes are without doubt among the best the UK has to offer. “Congratulations to all the 2019 Quality Award winners.”
