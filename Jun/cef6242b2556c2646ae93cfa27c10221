Chris Campbell, CESA CEO states, “We are hopeful that between the Development Bank of SA (DBSA) and the new Department of Public Works and Infrastructure (DPW&I) they will ensure that ‘value for money’, fair, transparent and cost-effective decisions will be made to maximize the outcomes being pursued through this seed funding.” Campbell states that these elements are essential to instill business confidence leading to foreign investor confidence for the further development of both social and economic infrastructure. Infrastructure is a critical area of investment that supports structural transformation, growth and job creation.
